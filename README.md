❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts whether a person has heart disease using Machine Learning. It follows a complete ML workflow:

Problem Definition – Can we predict heart disease based on patient health data?

Data – Uses a heart disease dataset with features like age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, max heart rate, etc.

EDA – Explored data distributions, correlations, and patterns.

Modeling – Trained multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, etc.).

Evaluation – Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
